# Code Q Neos-Skeleton

This Neos 3.x website is based on the [Code Q Code Conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ykoM0Ta2qJvO_6BYa-DIsx7_MxFsInOSbJqJHuINBw/edit). It is heavily inspired by the Neos [best practise examples](https://github.com/Flowpack/fusion-bp) and the [single repro setup by kitsunet](https://github.com/kitsunet/composer-install-testing).
The setup is based on docker [dimaip/docker-neos-alpine by dimaip](https://github.com/psmb/docker-neos-alpine), a [example file](docker-compose.example.yml) is included.
