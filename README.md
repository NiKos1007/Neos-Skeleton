# Code Q Neos-Skeleton

The Neos-Skeleton provides a easy and powerful start for new projects - beginner-friendly and highly scalable. It implements all current best practises for Neos 4.

It combines contributions of some of the best Neos developers with experience from Code Q. It is inspired by [Flowpack Neos best practise examples (Dmitri Pisarev and Dominique Feyer)](https://github.com/Flowpack/fusion-bp) and the [single repro setup (Christian MÃ¼ller)](https://github.com/kitsunet/composer-install-testing).
