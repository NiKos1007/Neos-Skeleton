# Code Q Neos-Skeleton

The Neos-Skeleton aims to provide a consistent start for new projects. It combines contributions of some of the best Neos developers with experience 
from Code Q. It is heavily inspired by the [Flowpack Neos best practise examples (Dmitri Pisarev and Dominique Feyer)](https://github.com/Flowpack/fusion-bp) and the [single repro setup by Christian MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/kitsunet/composer-install-testing).

The setup is based on docker [dimaip/docker-neos-alpine by dimaip](https://github.com/psmb/docker-neos-alpine), a [example file](docker-compose.example.yml) is included.
