# Code Q Neos-Skeleton

The Neos-Skeleton aims to provide a easy and powerful start for new projects. It combines contributions of some of the best Neos developers with experience from Code Q. It is heavily inspired by the [Flowpack Neos best practise examples (Dmitri Pisarev and Dominique Feyer)](https://github.com/Flowpack/fusion-bp) and the [single repro setup by Christian MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/kitsunet/composer-install-testing).

## Generator Features

The generators automatically match the node types to file names, so you do not need to manually define templatePath. Also the generator allows you to easily add editable fields in your template files, so for a property title just use:

`{titleEditable -> f:format.raw()}`

The `DefaultContentPrototypeGenerator`will create the Fusion:

```
titleEditable = Neos.Fusion:Tag {
	content = ${q(node).property("title")}
	content.@process.convertUris = ConvertUris
	@process.contentElementEditable = ContentElementEditable {
		property = "title"
	}
}
```
